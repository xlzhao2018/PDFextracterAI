Framework for the PDF Information Extraction Program
1.	Setup for PDF Parsing:
o	Use PyMuPDF or pdfplumber to extract text from each PDF.
2.	Keyword-Based Information Extraction:
o	Define keywords or regular expressions for each field (e.g., "First name," "Company," "Phone number") to identify relevant text within the PDF.
3.	Organizing Extracted Data:
o	Structure the extracted information according to your specified format (columns like "First Name," "Last Name," "Company," etc.).
o	Store this data in a dictionary or DataFrame format for easy manipulation.
4.	Generating an Excel File:
o	Use pandas to store data in a DataFrame and export it to Excel with each row representing a contact.
5.	Batch Processing:
o	Implement a loop to process multiple PDF files and append extracted information to the Excel file.
Sample Code Outline
Explanation
1.	Field Patterns: Regular expressions (re) are used to match each field's pattern in the extracted text.
2.	Extract Fields Function: The extract_fields_from_text function searches for each field's pattern in the PDF text and stores the found data in a dictionary.
3.	Batch Processing: process_batch_pdfs iterates over multiple PDF files, extracts the required information, and stores it in an Excel file.
4.	Excel Export: The extracted data is stored in a DataFrame and exported to an Excel file.
Next Steps and Customization
•	Refine Regex Patterns: Adjust the regex patterns for more accurate field matching, as some fields may require unique patterns.
•	Handle Missing Fields: Add logic to handle missing or multiple instances of fields in a single PDF.
•	Verification of Extracted Data: Consider adding validation steps to confirm the extracted data's accuracy.
